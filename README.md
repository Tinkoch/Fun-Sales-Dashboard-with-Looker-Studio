Welcome to the Looker Studio Dashboard Walkthrough!
Hi, everyone! Today, I’m excited to walk you through the Orders Dashboard I created using Looker Studio. This dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize sales data, and I’ll show you how each part works and what insights we can gain from it.

# 1. Overview of Metrics

At the top, you’ll notice four key performance indicators (KPIs):

Total Orders: 5,009 – This tells us the overall volume of orders.
Total Customers: 793 – A count of unique customers.
Number of States: 49 – How wide our sales coverage is geographically.
Number of Segments: 3 – The customer categories: Home Office, Corporate, and Consumer.
These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of the business performance.

# 2. Analyzing Orders by Categories

Below the KPIs, you’ll see three pie charts:

By Region: The West leads with 32% of total orders, followed by Central at 28.5%. These regional insights can help us decide where to focus resources.
By Category: Office Supplies is the top category at 39%, followed by Technology (31%) and Furniture (30%). This breakdown shows which products are most popular.
By Segment: Consumer orders dominate with 51.9%, which means most sales come from individual customers.
3. City Performance

On the right-hand side, I’ve included a bar chart of Orders by City. The top five cities are:

New York City (915 orders)
Los Angeles (747 orders)
Philadelphia, Seattle, and San Francisco follow closely.
This helps identify high-demand urban areas where marketing efforts are working.

# 4. Trend Analysis

There are two line charts that focus on trends:

Annual Orders: We see orders growing steadily over time, peaking in 2017.
Monthly Orders: However, there’s a clear decline from November to February, likely due to seasonal trends. This highlights an opportunity to boost sales during the slow months.

# 5. Customer Insights

At the bottom, you’ll find details on individual customers, such as:

Their Customer IDs.
The number of orders they placed. For example, Customer "JD-15895" is our top buyer with 150 orders. Insights like these can help target loyal customers with rewards or promotions.

# 6. Shipping Modes

On the left, there’s a filter for shipping modes: Standard Class, Second Class, Same Day, and First Class. This lets us analyze how different shipping options impact delivery times, costs, and customer satisfaction.

# How I Designed the Dashboard

Color Scheme: I used a pink and black theme to create a bold, modern look.
Filters on the Left: These allow users to customize the data view by region, category, and shipping mode.
Interactive Visuals: The charts and tables are dynamic, meaning they update based on the filters applied.
User-Focused Design: The layout ensures key insights are immediately visible, while more detailed information is presented below.
How You Can Use This

If this were your data, you could track performance trends, identify areas for growth, and make data-driven decisions.
The filters let you dive deeper into specifics like which shipping mode is most popular or which category performs best in a region.
